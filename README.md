# My personal dotfiles :coffee:

*disclaimer: README files within directories are personal notes to save the shortcuts i use in case i forget them, but when displayed in github, the markdown ignores \< and \>. To see all the shortcuts i suggest cloning the repo and opening the markdown file in a text editor*

### TODO:
- fold/unfold easily (requires integration to lsp i guess)
- make backspace not move line after deleting last character
- maybe switch terminal? what does things like zsh or fish give me over bash?

plugins:
- ranger (search for files and preview them)?
- colorizer
- file icons (nerd fonts)
- move blocks of selected code (and auto indent)
