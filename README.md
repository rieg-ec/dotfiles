# My personal dotfiles :coffee:

_disclaimer: README files within directories are personal notes to save the shortcuts i use in case i forget them, but when displayed in github, the markdown ignores \< and \>. To see all the shortcuts i suggest cloning the repo and opening the markdown file in a text editor_

### Installation

**from within the directory**:

1. `cp env.sh.example env.sh` and modify variables depending on installation needs
2. `chmod +x install.sh`
3. `./install.sh`

### TODO:

- learn to use/setup nvim-treesitter
- learn to use/setup vimspector
- fold/unfold easily
- make backspace not move line after deleting last character
- maybe switch to zsh

plugins:

- ranger (search for files and preview them)?
- colorizer
- file icons (nerd fonts)
- move blocks of selected code (and auto indent)
